(Fixed) Dsub 15's pins are circular rather than oval
(Fixed) Dsub 15's data lines need to go on the other side of the board (B.Cu) so that we can solder to them
(Fixed) J3's holes are too small (Square pins measured flat side and assumed to be diameter rather than diameter/sqrt(2)). Should be 1.2
(Fixed) Gap should be different. The current gap size results in residue copper being left behind. Maybe 0.2mm
(Fixed) Edgecut are te wrong dimensions
(Fixed) C4 should be 10uF
(Fixed) C12 has wrong footprint
(Irrelevant) make d1 and capacitor soldier pads larger
(Fixed) lm226 manlge ground underside i footprint(for Ã¥ stoppe kortslutning med 5v)
(Irrelevant) Switch's footprint is too big
(Fixed) 8 pin connectors have ground on the wrong side
(Fixed) Standoffs short ground to 5V
(Fixed) u1 pin 4(FB) and pin 8(SW) is swapped
(Fixed) u4 pin configuration(numbering) is entirely wrong
(Fixed) u6 pin configuration(numbering) pin 8 in the schematic should be pin 5 instead
(Fixed) J3's holes are in the wrong order
