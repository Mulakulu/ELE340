Dsub 15's pins are circular rather than oval
Dsub 15's data lines need to go on the other side of the board (B.Cu) so that we can solder to them
J3's holes are too small (Square pins measured flat side and assumed to be diameter rather than diameter/sqrt(2)). Should be 1.2
Gap should be different. The current gap size results in residue copper being left behind. Maybe 0.2mm
(Done) Edgecut are te wrong dimensions
C4 should be 10uF
C12 has wrong footprint
make d1 and capacitor soldier pads larger
lm226 manlge ground underside i footprint
Switch's footprint is too big
